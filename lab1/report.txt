1. kernel size with respect to spread of noise.
2. We don't save any time when using Conv2

What does it mean to be separable??

3. The greater the difference between filters...
4. No, it's absolute difference
5. Yes, there is an advantage because we just get the difference between two kernels and one convolution instead of running two convolutions and getting their difference.

6. Median is good at condiment filtering because it takes the middle values in a kernel. It is not as great for gassuian noise for other reasons.

7. Median filter for both works best.

8. Works the same as the regular mean filter.

...

17. Phase domain template matching is faster because we're only need to compare over one dimension instead of two.

18. Nailed it

19. yes!

20. No, this is not invariant to rotation.
