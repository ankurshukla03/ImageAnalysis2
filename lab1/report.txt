1. kernel size with respect to spread of noise.
2. We don't save any time when using Conv2

What does it mean to be separable??

3. The greater the difference between filters...
4. No, it's absolute difference
5. Yes, there is an advantage because we just get the difference between two kernels and one convolution instead of running two convolutions and getting their difference.

6. Median is good at condiment filtering because it takes the middle values in a kernel. It is not as great for gassuian noise for other reasons.

7. creating 3d noise images?

8. Any random image with noise?

9.


11. mu(regularization weight) is use for removing noise upto a certain level, we should be careful for choosing the value of higher value of mu will
not preserve the edges and low value of mu will not remove enough noises. No there wasn't much difference in value of PSNR and SSIM when we tried to tune it 
better.


12. No

13.  

14. Choosing NSFR value is the main obstacle for doing inverse filtering
15. Yes we compared and energy minimization approach outperform wiener filter with respect to PSNR and SISM value.

16.Wiener filter is optimal with the gaussian filter not with the non linear system.
